4 Principles:

1. Fluid Layouts
- To allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width (or even height)
- Use % (or vh / vw) unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport (usually layout)
- Use max-width instead of width
    Layout Types:
    1. Float Layouts
        - The old way of building layouts of all sizes, using the float CSS property. Still used but getting outdated.
    2. Flexbox
        - Modern way of laying out elements in 1-dimensional row without using floats. Perfect for component layouts
    3. CSS Grid
        For laying out elements in a fully-fledged 2 dimensional-grid. Perfect f or page layouts and complex components

2. Responsive Units
- Use rem unit instead of px for most lengths
- To make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically

3. Flexible Images
- By default, images don't scale automatically as we change the viewport, se we need to fix that- Always use % for image dimensions together with the max-width property

4. Media Queries
- To change CSS styles on certain viewport widths (called breakpoints)
